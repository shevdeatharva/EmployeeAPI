# Employee
Hi, 
tbl_Employee is the table that I have created in my local database as same as models.
filtering and pagination, For Filtering I have used EmployeeId to get data of that particular Employee.
pagination I have created api, in which I have used pagesize by default 10.

Everything is as same as you wanted it to be. All CRUD operations are available there.
